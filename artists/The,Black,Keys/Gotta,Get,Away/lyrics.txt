[Verse 1]
I got paid, then I was on the road
In a heartbeat, Mama said Mama said
You got a one track mind, but you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Verse 2]
My last dime, got used up
On gasoline, know what I mean, what I mean
Atlanta, GA by the end of the day
No other way, that's what I say

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Bridge]
And everything I had to say
Wish we'd gone so far away
Well now I
Can't stay

[Verse 3]
Blacktop, I can't stop
For no one, it's no fun, no fun
With a one track mind if you don't get lucky some time
But still I'm tryin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
