[Whistling]

[Verse 1]
I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you
Oh, what can I do? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true

[Verse 3]
Sick for days in so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how to get right
Yeah, it's out of sight

[Verse 4]
When I was young and movin' fast
Nothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass, I've come around
Oh come around, 'cause I've found

[Bridge]
Livin' just to keep goin'
Goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin'
It's such a shame

I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel
I'm tellin' you to be ready
My dear
