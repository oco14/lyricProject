[Verse 1]
Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can’t take much more

[Pre-Chorus]
I could never drown in

[Chorus]
They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's alright, ain't no guard in my house

[Verse 2]
Clouds covered love's
Barb-wired snare
Strung up, strung out
I just can’t go without

[Pre-Chorus]
I could never drown in

[Chorus]
They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's alright, ain't no guard in my house
They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's alright, ain't no guard in my house
