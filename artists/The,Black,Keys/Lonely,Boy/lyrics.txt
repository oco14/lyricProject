[Verse 1]
Well, I'm so above you and it's plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out and I don't mind bleedin'
Any old time you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'

[Verse 2]
Well, your mama kept you, but your daddy left you
And I shoulda done you just the same
But I came to love you, am I born to bleed?
Any old time you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Hey

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
