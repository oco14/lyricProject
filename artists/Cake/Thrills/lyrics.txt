Man is born, man lives, man dies
And it's all vanity

And that's about the way it is with the merry-go-round
You get on
You go around
Standing in the saddle

Man is born, man lives, man dies
And it's all vanity

He tried thrills

He said "I gave myself to enjoy pleasure"
What are teenagers doing today?
They're trying every thrill there is in the books
We've got colored TV
But it still isn't satisfying

Man is born, man lives, man dies
And it's all vanity

You can't understand it, it's going so loud, and so forth
And they're all wigglin' and wobblin' around and everything else and
And yet, they feel unsatisfied
And these disc jockeys they say here is a tune that is different
Hear the tone that is different

Man is born, man lives, man dies
And it's all vanity

You can't understand it, it's going so loud, and so forth
And they're all wigglin' and wobblin' around and everything else and
And yet, they feel unsatisfied
And these disc jockeys they say here is a tune that is different
Hear the tone that is different

Man is born, man lives, man dies
And it's all vanity
