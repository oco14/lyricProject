It's been a long time
Since I've seen your smiling face
It's been a long time
Since I've seen a su-u-u-u-u-u-unny day

It's been a long time
Since you wore your pillbox hat
It's been a long time
Since we drove your Po-o-o-o-o-o-ontiac

It's been a long time
Since you gave me bu-u-u-u-u-u-u-utterflies
It's been a long time
Since I've seen it bu-u-u-u-u-u-urning in your eyes

But I don't mind (I don't mind)
No I don't (I don't mind)
No I don't (I don't mind)
When I've got you next to me

It's been a long time
Since we tripped into this ditch
It's been a long time
Since we drank the ar-r-r-r-r-r-rsenic

It's been a long time
Since we've been insi-i-i-i-i-i-ide of this tomb
It's been a long time
Since you wore your e-e-e-e-e-expensive French perfume

But I don't mind (I don't mind)
No I don't (I don't mind)
But I don't (I don't mind)
When I've got you next to me
Next to me

It's been a long time
Since I've seen your smiling face
It's been a long time
Since I've seen a su-u-u-u-u-u-unny day
