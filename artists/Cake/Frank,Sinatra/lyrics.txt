[Hook]
We know of an ancient radiation
That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station
While Frank Sinatra sings Stormy Weather
The flies and spiders get along together
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record

[Verse 1]
Beyond the suns that guard this roost
Beyond your flowers of flaming truths
Beyond your latest ad campaigns
An old man sits collecting stamps
In a room all filled with Chinese lamps
He saves what others throw away
He says that he'll be rich some day

[Bridge]
We know of an ancient radiation
That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station

[Hook]
