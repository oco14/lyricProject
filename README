This is a continuation of my HackOhI/O 2018 project. This version has cleaner and readable code compaired to the original. 
This project pulls songs lyrics from an artist and breaks the lyrics down into individual words and their respective counts. 
In the future, I will be looking to analyze the data to support inferences made in reference to the artist.
