This projects goal was to web scrape the lyrics of certain songs and to break the songs down into individual words and number 
of occurances for the use of analysis. Currently the code is set up to scrape a list of popular songs from a given list of artists 
to then be used as descriped above. The songs will be stored in a directory named after the artist.
This is a continuation of my HackOhI/O 2018 project. This version has updated , cleaner/readable code compaired to the original. 
In the future, I will be looking to analyze the data to support inferences made in reference to the artist. The current version is 
the second branch. To run the code, run the file finalTest.py. The current list of artists are set to some of my favorites
Black Keys, Kanye West, Cake.
